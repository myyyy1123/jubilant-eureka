      <div class="card">
        <p>Lara Moore, 18, was just sailing under a clear blue sky when suddenly she saw a storm approaching. 
        She knew she couldn't escape in time, so she started to prepare by laying down to brace herself. 
        Then the storm came and made the boat wobbly. She thought she was prepared, but the boat's edge knocked her out. 
        She woke up in the morning, soaked in water while being lost in the middle of nowhere. Astoundingly, she had a phone signal, 
        so she called her mom, 22 kilometers away, but she didn't know where she was because her map was soaked in water. 
        Panicking, she thought she would starve to death, but she forgot that she could wait for the map to dry. 
        Then she got an idea: what if she could wait for the map to dry? So she waited. After the map dried, she called her mom, 
        who called emergency services. She had only 9% battery left. She waited for the emergency services to come rescue her.</p>

      <!-- Second block: Lara's quote -->
      <div class="card">
        <blockquote>
          "I was waiting for what seemed like hours in the middle of the sea," said Lara. 
          "I was about to give up hope when I heard the sound of a helicopter. It hovered above me and began lowering a rope."
        </blockquote>

      <!-- Third block: Hospital information -->
      <div class="card">
        <p>Lara was taken to the hospital yesterday. Although she didnâ€™t suffer serious injuries, she did have a concussion. 
        The doctor said she would need to stay for a day to recover.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Fourth block: Rescue service statement -->
      <div class="card">
        <p><strong>Rescue Service:</strong> "We are very glad that we were able to rescue Lara. The risk of storms is increasing this year. 
        All sailors should not go off-piste. Lara had a lucky escape."</p>
