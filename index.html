  <h1>Teen Rescued After Storm Knocks Her Unconscious at Sea</h1>
</header>

<article>
  <h2>By Floppa News Network – May 8, 2025</h2>

  <p><strong>Lara Moore</strong>, 18, was rescued after a terrifying ordeal at sea when a sudden storm struck her boat, knocking her unconscious and leaving her stranded.</p>

  <p>She had been sailing under a clear sky when she noticed a storm approaching. Realizing she couldn’t outrun it, Lara laid down to brace herself. The boat was rocked violently, and the impact from the edge of the boat knocked her unconscious.</p>

  <p>She woke up the next morning, drenched and alone. Despite being lost at sea, she had phone signal and called her mother, 22 kilometers away. However, her location was unknown as her map was soaked.</p>

  <p>“I panicked,” said Lara. “I thought I was going to starve out there.” She waited for the map to dry in the sun. Once dry, she found her location and contacted her mom again—with only 9% battery left. Emergency services were then dispatched.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "I was waiting for what seemed like hours in the middle of the sea," Lara said. "I was about to give up hope when I heard the sound of a helicopter. It hovered above me and began lowering a rope."
  </blockquote>

  <p>She was taken to a hospital and treated for a concussion. Doctors advised a one-day stay for observation.</p>

  <p><strong>Rescue Service:</strong> “We are very glad we were able to rescue Lara. The risk of storms is increasing this year. All sailors should avoid going off-piste. Lara had a lucky escape.”</p>

  <p>Lara’s quick thinking and patience helped save her life—and serve as a warning about being prepared at sea.</p>
